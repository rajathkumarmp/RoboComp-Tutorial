#Interfaces

RoboComp simplifies the task of coding your robot by using interfaces. Interfaces are .idsl files, consider it like libraries which provide functions that are most commonly used while programming the bot.

The interfaces are found in

	cd robocomp/interfaces/IDSLs

That folder contains the list of interfaces robocomp currently offers.

To use a particular interface in your project you import them in the cdsl file and tell the component what to do with the interface.
